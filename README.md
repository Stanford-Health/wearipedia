    <p>A one-stop shop for wearable device data extraction and simulation</p>
</h3>

Wearipedia provides a one-stop shop for accessing and extracting data from dozens of wearable devices, including devices from FitBit and Oura.

Data from these devices may be used for:

* Clinical research
* Personal health monitoring
* Health coaching
* Health product development
* Wearable device development

Wearipedia is developed and maintained by the [Snyder Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/snyderlab.html) at the Stanford University.

## Accessing data from wearable devices

The data from these devices is accessed using an easy-to-use API. In order to use this API, you will need to import the `wearipedia` module:

```python
import wearipedia
```

Once you have imported the `wearipedia` module, accessing data from any wearable device is as easy as:

```python
device = wearipedia.get_device("whoop/whoop_4")
device.authenticate({"email": "joesmith@gmail.com", "password": "foobar"})

# data is a DataFrame
data = device.get_data("metrics")
```

If you don't have access to your device, or need to demo data from a device without revealing your sensitive data or getting a device yourself, you can generate synthetic data, as shown below:

```python
device = wearipedia.get_device("whoop/whoop_4")

# data is an automatically generated DataFrame
data = device.get_data("metrics")
```

and you're done!

## Installing

The easiest way to install wearipedia is to use pip:

`pip install wearipedia`

## Disclaimer

This project is currently in a *pre-alpha* stage. This means that formal tests are not yet integrated, and the codebase is still really a prototype. Expect for most things to work, but also small bugs, rough edges, and no documentation.

## Contributing

As Wearipedia is still at an early stage, we are not yet accepting contributions from the broader community. Once Wearipedia reaches its first stable release, we will begin accepting contributions.

## License

Wearipedia is released under the MIT license.
